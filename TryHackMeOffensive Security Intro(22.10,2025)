**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Platform:** TryHackMe

## Goal
Find a hidden URL and interact with a simulated web form.

## What I did (eazy level)
- Used `dirb` to enumerate directories and discovered a hidden URL.
- Opened the discovered page and interacted with a simulated form.
- Performed a lab-only simulation: credited a test bank account with $2000.

## Result
Task completed successfully. All actions were performed in an isolated lab environment.

## Lessons learned
- Practical use of directory enumeration (`dirb`) for finding hidden resources.
- Caution when interacting with web forms — always ensure you have permission.
